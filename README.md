# Advanced reinforcement learning algorithms for precise car navigation and parking
This project focuses on applying advanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, such as TD3 and Options Critic, to a realistic modern problem: autonomous car parking. We developed a custom parking lot environment, incorporating sensors and physics-based interactions to simulate a highly realistic scenario. The use of advanced RL algorithms proved effective, as the agent demonstrated significant progress in learning within just a few episodes. In contrast, basic RL algorithms required significantly more episodes—up to ten times as many—to achieve a comparable level of learning. 

We worked on this as a part of our course project for CS5180 - Reinforcement Learning and Sequential Decision Making (Fall 2024) at Northeastern University, Boston.

## The Environment

The elements of the parking lots were created using Unity's built-in tools. For the cars, ready-made models from the “Low Poly Soviet Cars Pack” were used.
